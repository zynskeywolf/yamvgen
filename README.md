# Yet Another Music Video Generator
YAMVGEN is a simple Linux tool for auto-generating cover art images and "video clips" with a basic visualizer. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNvSCNo4uos">Here</a> is an example of what it is capable of.

After downloading it, simply run <code>install.sh</code> as root. No need to compile anything, it's just bash.

Some dependencies, please make sure you have these installed:
- bash (or compatible shell)
- ffmpeg (for outputting video and getting info about media files)
- inkscape (for rendering graphics)
- bc (for calculating the starting point of fade-out (yes, literally for this one thing only))

Full documentation is available at https://zynskeywolf.github.io/yamvgen.
